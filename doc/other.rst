Other useful utilities
======================

This chapter contains a list of most of the programs
that usually do not come installed as standard but
are very helpful and in most cases are more useful
that standard ones - especially on touchscreens.

1. pnmixer_ - THE best sound mixer applet, hands down.
   Can be easily bound to media keys, has adjustable
   step and works with pulseaudio.
2. blueman_ - way better than standard GNOME bluetooth
   applet
